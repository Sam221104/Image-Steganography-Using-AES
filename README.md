# Image Steganography with AES Encryption
## What is Steganography?
Steganography is the art of hiding secret information inside a non-secret medium in a way that prevents detection. Unlike cryptography, which scrambles data to make it unreadable, steganography conceals the very existence of the message. It is commonly used for secure communication, watermarking, and digital forensics.

## History of Steganography
### Ancient Methods
Steganography has been used for centuries, dating back to ancient Greece. Early methods included writing messages on wooden tablets and covering them with wax or hiding secret messages under new layers of ink on parchment.

### Tattoo Steganography
One of the most fascinating historical uses of steganography was tattooing messages onto a messenger’s body. In ancient times, Greek ruler Histiaeus sent secret messages by tattooing them onto a slave’s shaved head. Once the hair grew back, the message remained hidden until the recipient shaved the messenger’s head again. This method was an early form of biological steganography, using the human body as a medium for secret communication.

### World War Tactics
During World War II, microdots—tiny photographs containing entire pages of information—were used to send secret messages hidden inside innocent-looking documents or letters. Invisible inks and coded music notes were also employed to conceal messages from enemies.

### Digital Steganography in Modern Times
With the rise of digital media, steganography evolved to hide information within images, videos, and audio files. Today, it is used in cybersecurity, forensics, and covert communication.

## What is AES Encryption?
* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data. It is based on the Rijndael algorithm, designed by Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen.
* It operates on fixed 128-bit blocks and supports 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit keys.
* AES uses a combination of substitution, permutation, and key expansion to transform plaintext into an unreadable cipher.
* AES is trusted by governments, financial institutions, and security professionals because of its resistance to brute-force attacks and its efficiency in securing sensitive data.
* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) operates in multiple modes, and one of the most commonly used for security is **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)**. In CBC mode, encryption is performed block by block, with each block depending on the previous one. This adds an **extra layer of security** compared to simpler encryption modes like ECB (Electronic Codebook).

## Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography
Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography is a technique used to hide data within digital images by modifying the least significant bits of pixel values. Since these bits contribute the least to the overall color of a pixel, altering them has a negligible visual impact, making the changes imperceptible to the human eye.

## How This Project Works
* This project combines AES encryption with Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography to securely hide messages inside images.
  * Encryption: The input message is encrypted using AES-CBC mode with a key derived from a password using SHA-256 hashing.
  * Hiding in Image: The encrypted message is embedded into an image using LSB steganography, ensuring minimal visual distortion.
  * Decryption: The message is extracted from the image and decrypted using the correct password.

## Why Use LSB When AES Alone Is Not Enough?
* AES encrypts the message but doesn’t hide it.
* If someone intercepts the encrypted message, they know that hidden communication exists.
* Attackers can use brute-force methods to decrypt it if they suspect encryption.
* LSB provides stealth (hiding the message in an image).
* Even if someone accesses the image, they won’t notice that it contains hidden data.
* The image looks the same because LSB changes only the least significant bits, which are imperceptible to the human eye.
  * AES + LSB = Security + Stealth
* AES secures the data (making it unreadable without a key).</li>
* LSB hides the encrypted data (so no one even suspects there’s a hidden message).</li>

## How AES and LSB Work Together in Steganography
### AES Encryption
* The secret message is encrypted using the AES-CBC (or AES-ECB) algorithm.
* Padding is applied to make the message fit the AES block size (16 bytes).
* The encrypted message is converted to binary format.
### LSB Steganography
* The encrypted binary data is embedded into the Least Significant Bits (LSB) of the image pixels.
* Each pixel consists of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values.
* The last bit of each channel (R, G, B) is replaced with a bit from the encrypted message.
### Extraction and Decryption
* The binary data is retrieved from the image’s pixel LSBs.
* It is converted back into ciphertext and decrypted using AES, revealing the original message.

## Why Combine AES with LSB?
* AES provides security (even if the image is accessed, the message remains encrypted).</li>
* LSB ensures stealth (hidden data is imperceptible in the image).</li>

## Benefits of Using AES with LSB Steganography

### **1️. Dual-Layer Security**
- AES-CBC ensures the **message is encrypted** before being hidden, making it unreadable even if extracted.
- LSB steganography provides **covert transmission**, preventing detection by attackers.

### **2️. Enhanced Privacy & Confidentiality**
- **No Suspicion:** Unlike normal encryption, where the presence of ciphertext is obvious, steganography keeps messages hidden in plain sight.
- **Protected Key Generation:** SHA-256 is used to generate a strong encryption key from a password, **preventing brute-force attacks**.

### **3️. Data Integrity & Authenticity**
- AES encryption **ensures that data remains unaltered** during transmission.
- Any modification to the image **can corrupt the hidden message**, alerting the receiver of tampering attempts.

### **4️.  Universal Compatibility & Easy Sharing**
- **Images appear normal**, allowing safe sharing on **social media, emails, and cloud storage**.
- Base64 encoding helps in embedding encrypted data **without affecting image compatibility**.

### **5️. Efficient & Lossless Retrieval**
- The original hidden message **can be fully recovered** without degrading the cover image.
- Unlike watermarking, **steganography preserves visual quality** while ensuring data secrecy.

This **combination of cryptography and steganography** makes information security both **powerful and discreet**. 

## Summary  

This project combines **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-CBC) encryption** with **Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography** to securely hide messages within images.  

- **AES-CBC Encryption:** Encrypts messages before embedding them to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **LSB Steganography:** Hides encrypted data within image pixels, making the message undetectable.
